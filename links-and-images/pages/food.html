        Soy beancurd, also known as tofu pudding or douhua, is a popular East Asian
        dessert made from soy milk. It is prepared by coagulating freshly boiled soy
        milk with a natural coagulant, such as gypsum or nigari, then allowing it to set
        into a soft, delicate custard-like texture. Soy beancurd is often served warm or
        cold and can be enjoyed plain or with various toppings such as sweet syrup, ginger syrup, or 
        red bean paste. Known for its smooth and creamy consistency, soy beancurd is a 
        nutritious and versatile dessert loved by many for its subtle sweetness and comforting flavor.
